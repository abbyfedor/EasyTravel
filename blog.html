            <div class="first_text"> "My family and I used Easy Travel to book a vacation to Morocco and we 
                couldn't be happier! We are a well traveled family, but going to Morocco was going to be tricky, even for us. 
                We didn't know the best areas, how to connect with locals, or how to arrange transportation. Nobody in our family
                speaks Arabic, and we were concerned about booking accomodations. With Easy Travel, everything was a 
                breeze! We were able to book transportation to and from the airport without any trouble. 
                Easy Travel connected us with nice hotels in our price range that were kid friendly and well located.
                They suggested activities and an itinerary that suited my family's need. 
                I genuinley cannot imagine doing this trip without Easy Travel. Love this service!"

                Without Easy Travel, I don't know if I could have coordinated all the accomodations myself! We took trains
                very frequently to different hotels all over the different countries and I could not imagine doing all that 
                coordination myself! My family had an amazing time and I got to enjoy our trip without constantly having to worry
                about getting from one place to the next. Easy Travel makes every trip amazing!"

            I am quite a planner, so I didn't think I would need to use a travel agency. But when my wife suggested we go to Thailand, 
            I knew I might need some help. Easy Travel helped us find local restaurants, street markets, and bars to give us 
            the complete local experience. We loved Thailand and I will definitely be using Easy Travel again!"

            We are not the best planners so we knew we would need some help. I am so glad that we used Easy Travel!
            I have never worked with another service that was so easy to use. We ended up going for 10
            days and Easy Travel gave us flights with affordable prices and lots of activities to do while we 
            were there. I strongly reccomend using Easy Travel!"
